# Airfoil-Analysis-
This repository contains my ANSYS-based project completed as part of the course Computational Tools for Engineers (22CTE48). The project involves a comparative research and flow analysis of NACA 2412 and S1223 airfoils using ANSYS Fluent. The study focuses on evaluating aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift, drag, pressure distribution, and flow separation under varying angle of attacks. Simulation results are visualized and interpreted to draw meaningful engineering conclusions relevant to low-speed airfoil applications.
